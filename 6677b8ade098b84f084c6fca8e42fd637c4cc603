      "message": "Hi Greg,\n\nAs you may know, stock Android does something similar to what you suggest, more detailed actually. When one searches for \"San Jos\", a list of 4 results come up:\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n|San Jose, CA, USA 12:02 PM                     |\n|San JosÃ© Province, San JosÃ©, Costa... 2:02 PM  |\n|...                                            |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n\nI am a bit scared of suggesting something like that as part of Change 380245 because might be a bit weird that only two entries in the list have the additional context info. Naturally, the context info could also be added to the remaining cities in the list, but I just do not have the oversight to know whether or not that would fly with the senior contributers.",

      "message": "Greg, I looked into your suggestion about adding a new public method to programmatically concatenate the city name with the time zone info, so that users have it easier to tell apart entries with similar names.\nAlthough you are right that implementing this would be easy, I believe it would cause mixture of languages in the text displayed on the Desk Cloak app. For example, if my phone is in Korean, and I am scrolling down the list of world clocks, looking for San JosÃ©,  I will eventually come across something like:\n+---------------------+\nì‚°í˜¸ì„¸ \n(America/Los_Angeles)\n......................\nì‚°í˜¸ì„¸ \n(America/Costa_Rica)\n+---------------------+\n\nI am not sure such a mix of languages in the displays aligns with what the community would like to see. \n\nIf language consistency is as important as I presume it to be, then the only quick solution would be to add the Country name directly into cities.xml and all the translations.\n\nFor reference, stock android only hard codes time zones for USA cities. All other city names and time zones are queried from a remote endpoint upon user search. That would be cool feature to reproduce, but then again, scope is way bigger that what this change is supposed to be about.",

      "message": "TLDR: Unfortunately, for the additional dynamic display name to make sense, a full revision of the initial time zones would be needed.\n\nGreg, I implemented and tested your suggestion, locally. However, after loading up the app I realized the scope of the feature keeps growing beyond what I initially set out to do ðŸ˜ž\n\nFor example, there are 17 cities in cities.xml for which the time zone is \"America/New_York\". These include Ottawa, the capital of Canada, and Washington D.C., the capital of United States. These are all in UTC-5 time, so technically it makes sense that @jplemieux assigned them all to the same time zone. But this also means that, by including \"mTimeZone.getID()\" in the displayed name of the entries in the world clock, I would be exposing some hard-coded values that are misleading, geographically speaking... Ottawa is naturally not in New York.\n\nI would be willing to tackle such a feature, but as a follow up change, if you and any other dev supports it.  What do you think?",
