      "message": "Hi Greg,\n\nAs you may know, stock Android does something similar to what you suggest, more detailed actually. When one searches for \"San Jos\", a list of 4 results come up:\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n|San Jose, CA, USA 12:02 PM                     |\n|San José Province, San José, Costa... 2:02 PM  |\n|...                                            |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n\nI am a bit scared of suggesting something like that as part of Change 380245 because might be a bit weird that only two entries in the list have the additional context info. Naturally, the context info could also be added to the remaining cities in the list, but I just do not have the oversight to know whether or not that would fly with the senior contributers.",
