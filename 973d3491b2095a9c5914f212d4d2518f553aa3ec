They have nice nature, but they lack a timezone entry in LineageOS\u0027s Desk Clock app. It seems like the the capital city, San Jos√©, was overlooked or replaced by the city of San Jose, California (?). \n\nIf my understanding is correct, this feature implementation would require two separated changes:\n1. The new TZ requires a new entry to cities.xml just underneath \"C230\", and shifting down everything else. This is done as part of 380245.\n\n2. Go go trough the auto-translation and proofreading process in Crowdin. Then import then merge the translation .xml files. This is pending, naturally.\n\nMy hope is that, if this change is accepted , hopefully the follow up change will n not be so demanding, as the only difference from the name is now a tilde, which  not many languages even support.\n\nPlease let me hear your thoughts.",
